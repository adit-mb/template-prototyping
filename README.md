# Prototyping Template

This is a template to create and share early, exploratory web prototyping for a project. With this template, you can create multiple sketches, and automatically get a simple navigation menu to share the entire collection of prototypes. Each prototype gets it's own route.

## Using this template

Create your prototypes within the '(prototypes)' folder. The route will be named based on the folder name. Within the folder, the entry point of your prototype should be on a file called 'page.js'. Also create a 'documentation.md' file and include a yaml header in the file with a title and description attribute.
